# AtliQ-Mart---Supply-Chain-Analysis

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metro and tier-1 cities in the next two years. AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in poor customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and has requested their supply chain analytics team to track the 'On Time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.

**GOAL:**

This project aims to transform the company's decision-making processes by providing a comprehensive analysis of their operational performance. By utilizing cutting-edge data analytics tools and methodologies, AtliQ Mart seeks to identify key trends and patterns that will inform their expansion strategy into additional metro and tier-1 cities over the next two years.

**KEY INSIGHTS:**

•	All the key metrics (OT%, IF%, OTIF%) are far below the target.   
•	On average, orders are delayed by 0.42 days from the agreed delivery date.   
•	Lotus Mart, Coolblue, and Acclaimed Stores have the highest number of orders and also the most delays in delivering products on time.   
•	Ghee, curd, and butter products are the most delayed to be delivered.   
•	There have been no noticeable improvements in any of the key metrics in the last few months.   
•	There is a huge gap in IF% for most customers. Is it due to lower production?
