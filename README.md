# AtliQ-Mart---Supply-Chain-Analysis

**PROJECT OVERVIEW:**

AtliQ Mart is a growing FMCG manufacturer headquartered in Gujarat, India. It is currently operational in three cities: Surat, Ahmedabad, and Vadodara. They want to expand to other metro and tier-1 cities in the next two years. AtliQ Mart is currently facing a problem where a few key customers did not extend their annual contracts due to service issues. It is speculated that some essential products were either not delivered on time or not delivered in full over a continued period, which could have resulted in poor customer service. Management wants to fix this issue before expanding to other cities and has requested their supply chain analytics team to track the 'On Time' and 'In Full' delivery service levels for all customers on a daily basis so that they can respond swiftly to these issues.
